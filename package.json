  "description": "It's a common problem for many internet chefs; you find a recipe you want to try, pin it on Pinterest.com, come back 6 months later and find that the domain for the recipe no longer exists. Or you try something you really love, write it down on a recipe card to put in your recipe box, and then think to yourself \"What if my house burned down? I wouldn't even have this anymore.\" Or maybe you got halfway through and thought \"This is too much work\".",
